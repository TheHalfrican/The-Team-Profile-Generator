## Description:
This is a high quality Team Profile Generator. It will ask you a list of qeustions based on whether you're adding the Manager, an Engineer, or an Intern. These qeustions include name, employee id, email, office number, Github username, and the Intern's University. The entered information will then be used to create an HTML document that, when deployed, shows a page with every employee and thier respective information neatly displayed in card format. This application styles the page well and makes it friendly for mobile devices. 

## Usage
To use this application simply run it using "node index" from the command line of your terminal.

## Testing
You can test this application anytime by running the command "npm run test" in your terminal.
